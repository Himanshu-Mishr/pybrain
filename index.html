					<h1>Welcome to PyBrain</h1>
					<p>
						PyBrain is a modular Machine Learning Library for Python.
						Its goal is to offer flexible, easy-to-use yet still powerful algorithms
						for Machine Learning Tasks and a variety of predefined environments to
						test and compare your algorithms.
					</p>

					<p>
						PyBrain is short for <span class='important'>Py</span>thon-<span class='important'>B</span>ased <span class='important'>R</span>einforcement Learning, <span class='important'>A</span>rtificial <span class='important'>I</span>ntelligence and <span class='important'>N</span>eural Network Library. In fact, we came up with the name first and later reverse-engineered this quite descriptive "Backronym".
					</p>

					<p>
						<h2>How is PyBrain different?</h2>
						While there are a few machine learning libraries out there, PyBrain aims to be a very easy-to-use modular
						library that can be used by entry-level students but still offers the flexibility and algorithms for state-of-the-art
						research. We are constantly working on more and faster algorithms, developing new environments and
						improving usability.
					</p>

					<p>
						<h2>What PyBrain can do</h2>
						PyBrain, as its written-out name already suggests, contains algorithms for neural networks, for reinforcement
						learning (and the combination of the two), for unsupervised learning, and evolution. Since most of the current
						problems deal with continuous state and action spaces, function approximators (like neural networks) must be used to
						cope with the large dimensionality. Our library is built around neural networks in the kernel and all of the
						training methods accept a neural network as the to-be-trained instance. This makes PyBrain a powerful tool for
						real-life tasks.
					</p>

					<p>
						<h2>Using PyBrain</h2>
						PyBrain is open source and free to use for everyone (it is licensed under the <a href="pages/licence.html" >BSD Software Licence</a>).
						Just download it and start using the algorithms and modules in your own project or have
						a look at the provided tutorials and examples.

						If you use PyBrain for your research, we kindly ask you to cite us
						in your publications. Use the reference below or import this <a href="files/pybrain.bib" >bibtex reference</a>.
